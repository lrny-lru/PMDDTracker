PMDDTracker is a symptom tracking app for anyone who needs to keep track of symptoms for themselves. PMDDTracker is simplistic, so that the user has less to worry about and can easily enter a symptom without adding any stress to their life. 

The PMDDTracker app allows users to add a symptom to their  chart, edit symptoms previously added, and delete symptoms.

The app also allows used to view their Tuck chart by the severity of their symptoms, or by the date the symptom was added, in order to relay it to a healthcare professional.

Users can add as many details in their description as needed and can view the description of a specific symptom by clicking on the expand icon on their PMDDTracker chart.

PMDDTracker was built with React, using pure CSS and communicates with a live NodeJS/PostgresQL server.
